The application is a multiplayer game developed with a modular structure and strongly typed in TypeScript. It uses Zustand for state management and integrates highly styled components via Tailwind, with animations created using Framer Motion.

Directory Structure
Here is an overview of the main files and directories in the project:

    /SaveButton.tsx        # Save button
    /board
      /PlayerBoard.tsx     # Individual player's board

/store
  /cardStore.ts           # State management for cards with Zustand
  /characterStore.ts      # State management for characters
  /gameStateStore.ts      # Global game state
  /boardStore.ts          # Board state management

/types
  /cards.ts              # Types for cards
  /character.ts          # Types for characters

Data Flow
sql
Copier le code
page.tsx → Player count selection  
→ game/page.tsx → Creation of initial states  
→ CharacterSelect.tsx → Character selection  
→ GameLayout.tsx → Game setup  
State Management
cardStore.ts: Manages all card operations.
characterStore.ts: Maintains character selections.
gameStateStore.ts: Coordinates the global state.
Communication via Zustand ensures shared state.
Player Interactions
PlayerSection.tsx → Contains player-specific game areas
→ CardComponent.tsx for individual cards
→ CardStack.tsx for stacks
→ ActiveZone.tsx for the active play area
Key Relationships
Components → Stores
Key Technical Points
Zustand with persistence (zustand/persist) for global state.
Data validation with Zod.
Animations using Framer Motion.
Components under use client.
Your Task
Before generating or modifying code, ensure that a similar feature does not already exist in another script, component, or store. Consider the relationships between scripts, including dependencies or calls to other scripts. If a feature already exists, adapt the code to use the existing one instead of duplicating it.

Use this information to avoid any contradictions with the logic or elements already implemented. I would like you to
The player board contains a lower area with a rectangle that includes card zones. This rectangle extends off-screen, and its bottom part is not visible. Could you ensure that it is fully visible?
